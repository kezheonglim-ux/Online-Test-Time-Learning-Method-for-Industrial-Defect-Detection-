# Online-Test-Time-Learning-Method-for-Industrial-Defect-Detection-
Modern manufacturing requires defect detection systems that are efficient, adaptive and capable of identifying unknown defects. This research proposes an online test-time learning method using a YOLO26 nano classification model within an open-ended anomaly detection pipeline. A low-code platform is also developed to support easier implementation and practical use.

### Explanation

The offline preparation from notebook here is to develop and prepare the initial anomaly detection model before deployment. A YOLO-based model is used as a frozen feature extractor, only a small adapter layer and the stored normal reference features are updated during online testing. This makes the system more stable and avoids the risk of changing the entire model during deployment.

Normal training images are passed through the YOLO feature extractor to obtain visual feature embeddings and these embeddings are stored in a normal memory bank as reference patterns of normal products. During validation, normal validation images are compared with this memory bank to calculate a distribution of normal anomaly scores. The initial anomaly threshold is then calculated from this normal-score distribution rather than being directly predicted by the model. 
End of this stage, four deployment files are generated and saved for later testing and deployment. 

### Exported Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `yolo26n-cls.pt` | Provides the frozen YOLO feature extractor. It converts each incoming image into a visual feature embedding without retraining the YOLO model. |
| `ttl_adapter.pt` | Stores the lightweight online adapter. The extracted feature embedding is passed through this adapter before comparison with the memory bank. |
| `memory_bank.pt` | Stores the normal reference feature embeddings generated from normal training images. Incoming images are compared with this memory bank to calculate the anomaly score. |
| `threshold.json` | Stores the calibrated decision settings, including the anomaly threshold and update threshold. These settings are used to classify the image and control online updating. |
